# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Akka Serialization with Scala course (Udemy edition)

Powered by [Rock the JVM!](rockthejvm.com)

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Akka Serialization with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/akka-serialization) course on Udemy. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag by running the following in the repo folder:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `1.1-scala-recap`
* `1.2-akka-recap`
* `2.1-custom-serialization`
* `2.2-kryo`
* `2.3-avro`
* `2.4-protobuf`
* `2.5-serializers-benchmark`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.

### For questions or suggestions

If you have changes to suggest to this repo, either
- submit a GitHub issue
- tell me in the course Q/A forum
- submit a pull request!
